# Super Table

Super Table is a Craft CMS field type to allow you to create powerful tables. You can utilise all your favourite native Craft field types in your tables, including Assets, Users, Entries and even Matrix. Also supports many third-party field types.

### Field Settings

Editing a Super Table is very similar to editing a Table. You define your columns, giving them a Name and Handle, and now have the option to select any installed field type.

To edit the settings of a particular field, click on the small 'cog' icon on the far right of the table row. This will open a modal window where you can edit any settings for that field type. Don't forgot to hit Save button to save these field settings!
